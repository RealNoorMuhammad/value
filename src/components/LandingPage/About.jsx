          Vault coin is a NFT staking platform in the Bitgert network that
          allows NFT owners to stake their NFTs and earn staking rewards at the
          same time they are able to trade the staked NFT asset in the Vault
          marketplace. The platform will use its own token $VTC to use for the
          buying and selling of NFTs on our marketplace. The token will also be
          used for the staking rewards of NFTs that are being staked.
